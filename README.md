DESCRIPTION


The second attempt at writing a model to predict fantasy football scores. The game of interest is the official Premier League fantasy game (fantasy.premierleague.com). 

At present, this repository contains Jupyter Notebooks describing some features of the model and gives code snipptes. The project is very much a work-in-progress; expect regular updates (especially to the results section) over the following weeks and months.
