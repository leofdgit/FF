    "\n",
    "This notebook displays results obtained through exploration of the 2016-2017 fantasy football data. A reference to the \"true scores\" should be understood as a reference to the actual points a player attained, while predicted scores are those produced by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicting Overall Score\n",
    "\n",
    "One measure of the effectiveness of the algorithm is the difference between the predicted total score and the true total score for each player. Though ideally the scores predicted _each week_ should be close to the true scores each week, a closeness between the predicted and true total scores hints at the prediction algorithm giving reasonable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph below plots predicted scores against true scores for a randomly-chosen subset of the players. The predictions are made using the algorithm with learned parameters."
